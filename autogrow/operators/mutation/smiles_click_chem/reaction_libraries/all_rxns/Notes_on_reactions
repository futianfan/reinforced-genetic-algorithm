This director of reactions is the merger of the Robust and ClickChem librarys.
The reaction numbering starts with ClickChem numbering followed by the Robust reactions

Please see other libraries for more in-depth preparation notes

All functional groups that start with a lowercase or a number and "_robust" at the end are from the Robust_reactions
All functional groups that start with an uppercase and "_clickchem" at the endare from ClickChem reactions
