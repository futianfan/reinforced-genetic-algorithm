Many small modifications have been the reactions in this set which are derived from .

Small changes which were made include:
    - Adjusting some SMARTs to be more inclusive, when chemically acceptable.
    - Canonicalizing functional groups so that all reactions which use a functional group
        able to use the same functional group complementary_mol library
        - ie. 6 reactions require a general alkyne, but originally used multiple versions of
            same SMART even though there was no limiting factor that differed between them.
            So we made adapted those reactions to use the canonical smart parttern.

    -Reaction 22 changed case example:
        from c1ccccc1C(=O)C(=O)c1ccccc1ccccc1C(=O)
            -was missing a "c1" at the begining of reactant 1 or end of reactant 2
        to:    c1ccccc1C(=O)C(=O)c1ccccc1 c1ccccc1C(=O)
    -Reaction 53 edited reaction:

        1st reactant definition had a ";!OH1" which cause reaction to not work. This made test cases work.

        Changed reaction from:
        [c;$(c1[c;$(c[C,S,N](=[OD1])[*;R0;!OH1])]cccc1):1][C;$(C(=O)[O;H1])].[c;$(c1aaccc1):2][Cl,Br,I]>>[c:1][c:2]
        To:
        [c;$(c1[c;$(c[C,S,N](=[OD1])[*;R0])]cccc1):1][C;$(C(=O)[O;H1])].[c;$(c1aaccc1):2][Cl,Br,I]>>[c:1][c:2]

        c1ccccc1C(=O)C(=O)c1ccccc1ccccc1C(=O)
            -was missing a "c1" at the begining of reactant 1 or end of reactant 2
        to:    c1ccccc1C(=O)C(=O)c1ccccc1 c1ccccc1C(=O)


Major Changes

    1) Reaction #48 48_sulfon_amide:
        sulfonyl chloride is a reactant described in the original reaction, but sulfonyl chloride
            is an unstable intermediate which is unlikely to be commercially available. 
            Normally the reaction described would begin with a sulfonic acid with an R-group, which is
            converted to sulfonyl chloride before the reaction.
                - please see https://www.organic-chemistry.org/synthesis/N1S/sulfonamides.shtm  or
                - An easy and handy synthesis of sulfonamides directly from sulfonic acids or its sodium salts is performed under microwave irradiation, has shown a good functional group tolerance, and is high yielding.
                    L. De Luca, G. Giacomelli, J. Org. Chem., 2008, 73, 3967-3969.
        Because sulfonic acids are commercially available and make sense for the purpose of Autogrow,
            we chose to instead reduce this 2 step reaction to a simplified 1 step reaction
            Which starts with the sulfonic acids and directly react it with an amine. This of course would
            the intermediate generation of sulfonyl chloride in a wet lab setting.
        We modified the reaction and description accordingly.

                "RXN_NUM": 48
                },

    2) Reaction #7  Reaction 7 (7_thiazole)
        The thioamide described in the smarts notation ([N&H2]-C=[S&D1]) is highly restrictive and only allows for a 
            a NH2-C(R)=S with no execptions. This is a relatively rare compound not found within the commercially readily available
            ZINC dataset. Thioamides are easily generated from amides using P2S5 or Lawesson's reagent (https://www.chemtube3d.com/hetthioamides_thiazole_formation/). 
            For this reason we expanded the reaction to accept both thioamide(NH2-C(R)=S) and and a normal amide(NH2-C(R)=O)
            
            Because there can be resonance between the N and the S and both the NH2-C(R)=S and the NH=C(R)-SH structures 
            can be used in this reaction (please citations below), we expanded the definition to include both versions of the ligand
                The SMARTS was changed:
                    From:   [N&H2]-[C]=[S&D1]
                    To:     [$([N&H2]-[C]=[S&D1]),$([N&H1]=[C]-[SH1])]
                    # Add in oxygen version of the amide
                    To:     [$([N&H2]-[C]=[S&D1,O&D1]),$([N&H1]=[C]-[SH1,OH1])]

                Reaction changed:

                    From:   "[#6:6]-[C;R0:1](=[OD1])-[CH1;R0:5](-[#6:7])-[*;#17,#35,#53].[NH2:2]-[C:3]=[SD1:4]>>[c:1]2(-[#6:6]):[n:2]:[c:3]:[s:4][c:5]([#6:7]):2"
                    To:     "[#6:6]-[C;R0:1](=[OD1])-[CH1;R0:5](-[#6:7])-[*;#17,#35,#53].[$([N&H2:2]-[C:3]([*:6])=[S&D1:4]),$([N&H1:2]=[C:3]([*:6])-[SH1:4])]>>[c:1]2(-[#6:6]):[n:2]:[c:3]([*:6]):[s:4][c:5]([#6:7]):2"

                    -The extra ([*:6]) was added to the thioamide so that any R-groups branching from that carbon are retained in the final product due to the switch to recursive smarts
                
                    # Add in oxygen version of the amide
                    To:     "[#6:6]-[C;R0:1](=[OD1])-[CH1;R0:5](-[#6:7])-[*;#17,#35,#53].[$([N&H2:2]-[C:3]([*:6])=[S&D1,O&D1:4]),$([N&H1:2]=[C:3]([*:6])-[SH1,OH1:4])]>>[c:1]2(-[#6:6]):[n:2]:[c:3]([*:6]):[s:4][c:5]([#6:7]):2"
