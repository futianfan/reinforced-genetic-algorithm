All ligands started from Retrieved on 12/19/19

We retrieved ligands from the Zinc15 database.
    The ligands retrieved were limited to:
        1) commercially available (wait Ok or sooner)
        2) MW less than or equal to 250Da
        3) LogP less than or equal to 5.0
        4) Any level of reactivity level. (ie Most reactive: Hot)

    This resulted in 19,274,338 substances and 420 Tranches


This list was further filtered to ensure that the SMILES could be converted to rdkit mol object
and filtered with Lipinski Strict Filter.
We populated the functional group libraries using this list.

Compounds were sorted by molecular weight, 
Libraries exceeding 5,000 ligands were further minimized taking only the lightest 5,000 compounds..
We favored low molecular weight as AutoGrow tends to grow compounds.

All compounds were tested to ensure they will react in all reactions they may be called in.

Total number of different Zinc15 compounds: 45,741

The default fragment libraries included with AutoGrow were derived 
from a subset of the ZINC database (https://zinc.docking.org/).
We thank ZINC for allowing us to distribute these fragment 
libraries to AutoGrow users.
