# reinforced genetic algorithm for structure-based drug design


This blog is written to introduce our recent NeurIPS 2022 paper [1]: Reinforced Genetic Algorithm for Structure-based Drug Design. 


The paper proposes a reinforcement learning based genetic algorithm for structure-based drug design. 


Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to discover drug candidates by finding molecules (ligands) that bind tightly to a disease-related protein (targets), which is the primary approach to computer-aided drug discovery.
